 In the Group CRUD Integrations branch contains the sql database used for the project, create a database called "swapproj" and import the sql file into it.
 Download all the php files and put them into a singular folder and open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
 There are a few student accounts and an admin and facility manager account (ad1 & fm1) all passwords are set to "qwe" for convenience.
 To make more admin/facility manager accounts, use register.php
 
 
 As for the Individual CRUD Operations, they have their own set of files that may already exist in the Group CRUD Integration branch, but these files may or may not contain changes to the original Group CRUD files 
 to fit the new requirements, hence download the php files into a different folder
